In turn, they gave us moments to cherish. The memories of visiting Prerna and Cheers foundation orphanage are some of those that would hold dear to us for a long time. The event began with hoisting the flag where the volunteers, the kids, caregivers and founders of the orphanage came together to celebrate their patriotism towards the mother nation. We have conducted events ranging from housie to musical chairs. Later in the day, when we played songs, the kids started to dance along to the tunes of the songs. We also provided the kids with some gifts, where the children also looked content and their happiness was indeed encouraging and fulfilling for us. The enthusiasm and the joy in the kids’ eyes and the love they had for us filled our hearts with utmost delight. We'd like to express our gratitude to all the contributors who made the event engaging and successful."

So, on the NSS day, the proud Bitsians took on the initiative of making the campus clean and thus, a successful cleanliness drive was organised by NSS on 24th September 2022. Many volunteers actively participated in the drive where they started collecting trash and garbage scattered from various places and ultimately dumping them in the dustbins where they were originally meant to be in and thereby motivating other students not to throw their wastes on campus grounds. We are always keen to conduct such drives in future and looking forward to your active participation."

Cleanliness is fundamental to anyone in society. To address this issue in a creative manner, NSS teamed up with the Dramatics Club.

The volunteers indeed proved that “A man without education is like a building without foundation!” An event “Aptitude and Reasoning test” was conducted that aimed to test the IQ of children, and career guidance was given accordingly. Some other events included Awareness sessions about Moral etiquettes, correct posture and basic manners which mainly focussed on how greed can influence to do bad things and importance of being loving, caring, kind and compassionate towards living beings around us and to inculcate good habits, importance of Value Education and how it can help students to become sensible and responsible citizens. The students have shown great enthusiasm and active participation throughout the events. The main idea behind this event is “People come and go, but it is only “Knowledge” that remains beyond death.!"

We borrowed about 87 saplings and distributed them in the nearby villages of Anthaipally, Thimmaipally and Thumkunta.
